"Synthesis, Connecting the Dots",june-2008-synthesis-connecting-the-dots,"Currently we believe that developers are writing unnecessary dependency wired tests to cover uncertainty about the validity of simulated interactions in their dependency neutral tests. In other words, we cannot be certain that all our simulated interaction based tests ‘join up’. If it were possible to correlate the simulated interactions in our tests, then we should be able to do away with the need to write large numbers of complex, slow and brittle wired tests (apart from those which interact with the boundaries of the SUT).

Synthesis combines lightweight tests to build confidence that the system under test is complete and reduces the need for large, overarching tests.

The Circuit Breaker Pattern,november-2014-the-circuit-breaker-pattern,"One constant in life is that shit goes wrong. When there’s an electrical surge in your house, every appliance doesn’t blow up because of a variety of fail safes, most commonly, fuses and circuit breakers.

In software systems, the Circuit Breaker pattern helps to keep misbehaving systems/resources from bringing down the entire estate. Restoring everything to normal once the offending resource starts behaving again.

The Circuit Breaker is a simple pattern that helps us to build robust, self healing systems that don’t require manual intervention to keep running. So sleep tight.

This month, [Ash Moran](http://blog.patchspace.co.uk) and [Mark Kirschstein](https://twitter.com/markkirschstein) will lead a practical hands-on session into the circuit breaker pattern.

Participating isn’t compulsory, but you’ll get the most out of the session if you bring along a laptop with ruby installed. Try and make sure you’re fully charged as we cannot guarantee access to plug sockets.

## The speakers

Ash is a software developer of 10 years. He likes making things that don’t fall on their arse at the first sign of trouble, so he was enthusiastic about working with Mark to bring the Circuit Breaker pattern to Ruby.

Mark is a Manchester-based developer who helps organise [XP Manchester](http://xpmanchester.wordpress.com)

Concurrent Ruby,may-2015-concurrent-ruby,"Historically it’s been up to languages other than Ruby to come up with new approaches for handling concurrency, but now that leaves Ruby in a position to provide lots of the good ideas in one place. The [Concurrent Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/concurrent-ruby) provides a wide range of tools with many different ways to look at concurrency. Actors, agents, async, futures, dataflow, promises, tasks, channels, thread pools, conditions, barriers, exchangers, semaphores, atomics and more, all in one place.

We’ll look at what the gem provides, how to pick what you need, how to use some of them, and what kind of scalability and performance you can get from them. **[Sign-up to attend](http://attending.io/events/nwrug-may-concurrent-ruby)**.

Sponsorship this month is provided by [Sage UK](http://sage.co.uk).

An Intro to Docker,july-2015-an-intro-to-docker,"You may have heard of Docker: its a way to package, distribute and run software. It has seen rapid growth, and coupled with the micro-service architecture perhaps it will replace VMs as the king in the future of cloud computing.

This talk aims to introduce newcomers to Docker: what it is and where you might use it and how to get started. In the process we will build and run a Rails app in a container, which will be a good way to demonstrate the basics and give you a head start to play with Docker yourself.

TDD and ‘Self’-Shunt,july-2013-tdd-and-self-shunt,"Leave your mocking frameworks at home, as Gemma Cameron and Iain Mitchell take us on a journey through ‘self’-shunt testing.

This month [Gemma Cameron](https://twitter.com/ruby_gem) and [Iain Mitchell](https://twitter.com/iainjmitchell) will be demonstrating an alternative to using mocking frameworks in your tests using the ‘self’-shunt testing pattern. They will be working through the [checkout kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_nine_back_.html), test driving it as if they really meant it, and showing how to drive out good design from the beginning by telling and not asking. There will be a huge focus on tiny, incremental changes and refactoring to the nth degree. Expect lots of code smells to be neutralised whilst they sip gin between commits.

The Life of a Rails Freelancer,march-2008-the-life-of-a-rails-freelancer,"A lot of people inspired by Ruby on Rails have thought about setting up on their own either as a freelancer, a contractor or maybe creating a business started with an idea that Rails put within their grasp. [Paul Robinson](http://vagueware.com) started out with a load of business ideas, started freelancing and even contemplated contracting, and is now seeking investment for a new business all over again.

In the process he almost went bankrupt – twice – re-wrote his business plan (he didn’t start with one he admits, beyond “make a living”) and learned the hard way about cash-flow/finance, legal structures, tax, finding work, keeping customers happy, what the Rails market is really like to work in and why being your own boss is worth the occasional pain.

In this talk, he shares as much as can fit into the time allowed and encourages you to learn from his mistakes when starting out as your own boss.

The Effects of Gravity on Software,november-2007-the-effects-of-gravity-on-software,"This month we are lucky enough to have [Kevin Rutherford](http://silkandspinach.net/) speaking on “The Effects of Gravity on Software”, very much a discussion based session taking a fresh look at ways to design software that might not be that traditional fully tiered model that we are all so used to. We also have [Dave Verwer](http://daveverwer.com) giving us a very brief look at [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net) and the new Microsoft MVC framework.

### The Effects of Gravity on Software – [Kevin Rutherford](http://silkandspinach.net/)

Do prices really rise? Is it really possible to bring a meeting forward? Can an argument hold water? What lurks around the corner? Well, here are my two cents worth: Metaphor shapes not only our language, but our thoughts too. So much so, that some of the common, deeply-ingrained metaphors of software development can actually prevent us from achieving good design. In this session we’ll lift the lid on the fascinating world of metaphors, and along the way we’ll discover a six-sided shape that has the answer to our prayers.

Kevin Rutherford has over twenty-five years’ experience in software development and has spent the last ten years as an agile coach. During the same period he has been a leading speaker on the agile conference circuit, including XP2000, SPA2006, AgileNorth 2005 and various XPdays around Europe. Kevin founded AgileNorth, Manchester’s agile software development interest group. Kevin is a Certified ScrumMaster, a CEng and a CITP, and is currently looking to turn away from coaching and return to development, which is a proper job.

### IronRuby and the ASP.NET MVC Framework – [Dave Verwer](http://daveverwer.com/)

This will be a lightning quick 15 minute overview of [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net/) and the new MVC framework from Microsoft which, together should be a fairly familiar sight to anyone who has used Ruby on Rails.

### Take a REST with Rails with Rob Lee

A look at the new features in Rails 1.2 that support the REST architectural style. Starting with a basic overview of REST and then looking at the modifications to routing, generators and the shift in conceptual design to deploy RESTful applications on Rails. To finish, we’ll take a (quick) look at consuming RESTFul resources with ActiveResource.

### Women in Engineering with Gemma Cameron

My experiences of being a minority within the software engineering field. My thoughts on why it seems to be white, middle class, male dominated and what I think we can do to help diversify the demographic. Please bring along your own opinion on this as there will be plenty of time for questions and debate!

“Those who don’t understand UNIX are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.”

We in the Ruby Community seem to have a habit of re-inventing things. Sometimes this is for good reason, but in some cases we don’t know we’re even doing it! We’re wasting valuable time that could be spent learning Erlang!

UNIX-like operating systems have been around for decades and lots of problems have come and gone in that time. I’m going to talk about some of the tools available that can be used to solve common Ruby and Rails deployment and development problems.

Brightbox will also be sponsoring the event so there will be pizzas available after the meeting in Odder across the road from the meeting.

Bootstrapping for Developers,march-2013-bootstrapping-for-developers,"Do you have ambitions to be your own boss? Have you ever had a side-project that you wanted to turn into a product and charge people money for? Well then this talk is for you…

#### Whats the Deal?

Most developers at some point or another have had an idea for an app or side project and wondered if they could take things a step further and turn it into an actual business. This talk will explore some of the ideas and common pitfalls that developers will face when trying to build a business like this in their spare time.

Unobtrusive JavaScript and Mystery Ruby,may-2007-unobtrusive-javascript-and-mystery-ruby,"This month we have [Dave Verwer](http://shinydevelopment.com) talking about how to tame JavaScript into behaving in your Rails applications with “Unobtrusive JavaScript with Rails” and [Paul Robinson](http://vagueware.com) doing a “Mystery Ruby” session.

### Unobtrusive JavaScript with Dave Verwer

With every site you visit piling on more and more JavaScript and Ajax, what happens when a user comes along using a screen reader or mobile device that would choke on even a simple alert()? How can we take advantage of the power of these technologies without providing any barriers to users, this session will cover techniques to ensure that you can still serve up rich content without excluding users, all from one code base and will cover the [Unobtrusive JavaScript](http://ujs4rails.com) plug-in for Rails.

### “Mystery Ruby” Session with Paul Robinson

Ruby is a language that anybody can pick up the basics of within an hour or so, and most Rails programmers will have a working application up and running before they need to even learn what iterators are available. This talk scratches below the surface, and promises to teach a few corners of Ruby and Rails you might not have seen before (and if you have seen them, we promise not to bore you to death). We’ll go in-depth on some basics everybody should know – :like :what :those :funny :symbols :actually :are – and run through a cheat-sheet of tricks and hints that give a clue as to where to dig a little further.

Improve your Ruby Code with Dependency Injection,october-2013-improve-your-ruby-code-with-dependency-injection,"Most of us have heard the vague, hand waving spiel about why DI is important for writing flexible, reusable code. A little harder to come by are examples of how one actually goes about doing it in a (cost) effective manner.

Rather than a dry introduction to Dependency Injection, this talk will be packed full of code examples demonstrating practical techniques you can start using straight away; no gems, meta-programming or magic required. We’ll also explore how you might persuade your Rails app to benefit from DI.

Expect a lively discussion on the merits (and demerits) of dependency injection in Ruby.

## How to take part

To participate, you’ll need to bring a laptop with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation) installed (either 1.9 or 2.0 as 2.1/2.2 are not fully supported by the challenge); and a copy of the [Bundler gem](http://bundler.io/). If you don’t have a laptop but still want to take part, email [Tekin](mailto:tekin@tekin.co.uk) and we’ll try and facilitate something.

You’ll also need some understanding of Ruby, although folk will be on hand to give help and guidance if you have problems getting going.

If you need any help getting Ruby/Bundler set up on your laptop, please come at 6:30pm and someone will be on hand to help you get set up.

Also do try and make sure your laptop is fully charged as there won’t be enough power sockets for everyone.

The session will run for around 2 hours from 7pm, plus some wrap up time. You should **aim to arrive and get settled before 7pm so that we can hit the ground running**.

## The schedule

- 6:30pm - Doors open and installation/setup

Making Music with Ruby,february-2015-making-music-with-ruby,"Alex is going to teach us how to use a Ruby DSL to make music! If you want to join in, bring your laptops.

## Tell me more!

Live coding is a type of music performance and composition that most people probably don’t even know exists. Long a niche activity, the Sonic Pi editor and language aim to leverage it to teach music composition using programming (and vice versa), using a powerful Ruby DSL – thus making the project of particular interest to Rubyists.

In this interactive session, we’ll have a quick run-down of the syntax and fundamentals, and then make some music using it! To get involved, you’ll need a mac, windows or linux machine and the sonic pi editor, available for free at [here](http://sonic-pi.net/)

Participating isn’t compulsory, but you’ll get the most out of the session if you bring along a laptop with ruby installed & sonic pi editor. Try and make sure you’re fully charged as we cannot guarantee access to plug sockets.

## The speaker

Alex is a Ruby/Clojure dev for Swirrl and a gear-obsessed guitarist. After some fun experiments with ChucK and the Overtone Clojure library, he’s now a convert to Sonic Pi as the most intuitive live-coding environment yet.

## The schedule

Nils - what are your Options?,may-2013-nils-what-are-your-options,"Tony Hoare, inventor of the null reference, calls it his “billion dollar mistake”. Although Ruby goes some way to correcting it by making `nil` at least be a class with some reasonably helpful stuff on it, you’ll no doubt have been hit by a `NoMethodError: undefined method 'foo'` just as many times as me.

At May’s NWRUG, [Russell Dunphy](http://twitter.com/rsslldnphy) will try to convince you of two thing:

1. There are not one, but two types of `nil`
2. They are not a necessary evil - we can do something about them.
